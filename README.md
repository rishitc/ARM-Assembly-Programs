# ARM-Assembly-Programs
This is a collection of programs that I work on during my Microprocessor and Computer Architecture Laboratory.

These programs are written in pure ARM assembly and were tested on ARMSim#.

Below are the list of programs that I worked on each week,
1. Week-1
    i. Write an ALP using ARM instruction set to add and subtract 2 numbers in the register
   ii. Write an ALP to demonstrate logical operations
  iii. Write an ALP to add 5 numbers where values are present in registers
  iv. Write an ALP using ARM instruction set to check if a number is even or odd
   v. Compare the value of R0 and R1, add if R0 = R1, else subtract
   
2. Week-2
    i. Write an ALP to find the factorial of a number stored in R0. Store the result value in R1
   ii. Write an ALP wgich based on the value of the number stored in R0,
        a. Store 1 in R1 if R0 is 0
        b. Store 2 in R1 if R0 is positive
        c. Store 3 in R1 if R0 is negative
  iii. Write an ALP to add 2 numbers loaded from memory and store the result in memory
   iv. Write an ALP to copy n numbers from location a to location b
    v. Write an ALP to add an array of numbers from memory
   vi. Write an ALP to find the GCD of given numbers (I have implemented this using Euclid's Algorithm)
