# ARM-Assembly-Programs

This is a collection of programs that I work on during my Microprocessor and Computer Architecture Laboratory.

These programs are written in pure ARM assembly and were tested on ARMSim#.

Below are the list of programs that I worked on each week,

1. **Week-1**

   1.  Write an ALP using ARM instruction set to add and subtract 2 numbers in the register

   2. Write an ALP to demonstrate logical operations

   3. Write an ALP to add 5 numbers where values are present in registers

   4. Write an ALP using ARM instruction set to check if a number is even or odd

   5. Compare the value of R0 and R1, add if R0 = R1, else subtract

      


2. **Week-2**


   1. Write an ALP to find the factorial of a number stored in R0. Store the result value in R1

   2. Write an ALP which based on the value of the number stored in R0,

      * Store 1 in R1 if R0 is 0

      * Store 2 in R1 if R0 is positive

      * Store 3 in R1 if R0 is negative

   3. Write an ALP to add 2 numbers loaded from memory and store the result in memory

   4. Write an ALP to copy n numbers from location a to location b

   5. Write an ALP to add an array of numbers from memory

   6. Write an ALP to find the GCD of given numbers (I have implemented this using Euclid's Algorithm)



## Note

ALP: Assembly Language Program

Rx: Register number x
